# Flight-Ticket-Price-Prediction
This case is a hackathon conducted by MachineHack. I participated in it and did this project.

Flight ticket prices can be something hard to guess, today we might see a price, check out the price of the same flight tomorrow, it will be a different story. We might have often heard travellers saying that flight ticket prices are so unpredictable. Huh! Here we take on the challenge! As data scientists, we are gonna prove that given the right data anything can be predicted. Here you will be provided with prices of flight tickets for various airlines between the months of March and June of 2019 and between various cities.

I've used Linear Regression & Regularisation techniques such as Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net Regression in this project.
